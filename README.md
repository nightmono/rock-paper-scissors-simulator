# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Simulator

Built using Python's Tkinter and it's canvas widget. Made this to hopefully practice and build more Tkinter canvas apps in the feature.

## Configuration

You can configure the following by editing the constants at the start of the script:

- The canvas width and height
- Amount of pieces for each item
- Delay between each game tick
- Speed of pieces
 
These are the defaults:

```py
CANVAS_WIDTH = 500
CANVAS_HEIGHT = 500
# Amount of pieces for each group.
PIECES = 50
# Delay must be an interger.
# 20ms delay is equal to 50 FPS.
DELAY = 20
# Speed of items.
SPEED = 2
```

You can change the pngs to whatever you like, just make sure they are named correctly.
