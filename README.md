# Rock Paper Scissors Simulator

Built using Python's Tkinter and it's canvas widget. Made this to hopefully practice and build more Tkinter canvas apps in the feature.

The canvas width and height, amount of pieces for each item, delay between each game tick, and speed of pieces can be changed by editing the constants at the start of the script.
